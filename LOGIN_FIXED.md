# âœ… Login Issue Fixed!

## Problem Identified

The login was failing with "Network Error" because of a **CORS configuration issue**.

### Root Cause

The browser was accessing the frontend at `http://127.0.0.1:3000` but the backend CORS was only configured to allow `http://localhost:3000`. These are treated as different origins by browsers.

## Solution Applied

Updated `docker-compose.yml` to allow both origins:

```yaml
backend:
  environment:
    CORS_ORIGINS: http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

## Verification

âœ… CORS configuration updated
âœ… Backend restarted with new settings
âœ… Both `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` now allowed

## Test Login Now

### Option 1: Use localhost
1. Go to <http://localhost:3000/login>
2. Login with test credentials

### Option 2: Use 127.0.0.1
1. Go to <http://127.0.0.1:3000/login>
2. Login with test credentials

### Test Credentials

- **Email**: test@example.com
- **Password**: testpassword

Or register a new account at <http://localhost:3000/register>

## Verify It's Working

```bash
# Test from command line
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'username=test@example.com&password=testpassword'

# Should return a JWT token
```

## What Changed

**Before**:
```yaml
CORS_ORIGINS: http://localhost:3000
```

**After**:
```yaml
CORS_ORIGINS: http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

This allows the frontend to connect from either URL.

## If Still Having Issues

1. **Clear browser cache and cookies**
   - Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   - Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   - Safari: Cmd+Option+E

2. **Try incognito/private mode**

3. **Check browser console** (F12)
   - Should no longer see CORS errors
   - Should see successful login request

4. **Verify services are running**
   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```

## Success Indicators

When login works, you should see:

1. âœ… No "Network Error" message
2. âœ… Redirect to dashboard
3. âœ… Token stored in browser
4. âœ… Backend logs show: `"POST /api/v1/auth/login HTTP/1.1" 200 OK`

## Additional Notes

### Why This Happened

Browsers treat `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` as different origins for security reasons, even though they resolve to the same IP address. This is a common issue in web development.

### Best Practice

In production, you would:
- Use a proper domain name
- Configure CORS to only allow your production domain
- Use environment-specific CORS settings

### For Development

The current configuration allows both `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` which is perfect for local development.

## Next Steps

1. âœ… **Login should now work!**
2. Create your account at <http://localhost:3000/register>
3. Subscribe to a plan to access signals
4. View signals at <http://localhost:3000/dashboard>

## Quick Test

```bash
# Register (if needed)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"your@email.com","password":"yourpassword"}'

# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'username=your@email.com&password=yourpassword'
```
