# Infrastructure roadmap

This directory is reserved for future Terraform modules, GitHub Actions workflows, or Pulumi stacks that provision
cloud infrastructure for SignalStack. Suggested components:

* Managed PostgreSQL (AWS RDS, Supabase, Neon)
* Redis cache/queue (Upstash, Elasticache)
* Container orchestration (ECS Fargate, Fly.io, Railway)
* Object storage for log archives and static exports
