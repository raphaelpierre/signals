```yaml
prometheus:
  image: prom/prometheus
  volumes:
    - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
  ports:
    - "9090:9090"

grafana:
  image: grafana/grafana
  ports:
    - "3001:3000"
```

2. Create dashboards for:
   - API request rate and latency
   - Signal generation metrics
   - Cache hit rates
   - Exchange API errors
   - WebSocket connections

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Production)
1. ✅ Set up Prometheus + Grafana
2. ✅ Configure alerting (PagerDuty/Slack)
3. ✅ Enable structured logging in production
4. ✅ Set up log aggregation (ELK/Datadog)

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)
1. Load testing with realistic traffic patterns
2. Tune cache TTLs based on usage patterns
3. Adjust rate limits based on subscription tiers
4. Add more comprehensive backtesting periods

### Long-term (1-3 months)
1. Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
2. A/B testing framework for strategies
3. Multi-region deployment
4. Advanced alerting with anomaly detection

## Support & Maintenance

### Key Commands

```bash
# View logs
docker compose logs -f backend

# Run tests
cd backend && pytest

# Check metrics
curl http://localhost:8000/metrics

# Test WebSocket
wscat -c "ws://localhost:8000/api/v1/ws?token=<token>"

# Run migration
python backend/run_migration.py

# Check Redis
docker compose exec redis redis-cli ping
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Column does not exist**: Run migration
2. **Cache not working**: Check Redis connection
3. **Rate limit not working**: Check Redis keys
4. **Tests failing**: Install dependencies
5. **WebSocket not connecting**: Check logs for errors
