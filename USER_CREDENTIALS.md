# Available Test User Credentials

All users have been updated with passwords that meet the frontend requirements (8+ characters):

## 🔐 Test User Accounts

| Email | Password | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `demo@example.com` | `demo1234` | Main demo account |
| `testuser@example.com` | `testpass123` | Test user account |
| `newuser@example.com` | `newpass123` | Another test account |
| `testlong@example.com` | `password123` | Recently created account |
| `test123@example.com` | `password123` | Also recently created |

## ✅ Backend Status
- All users can successfully authenticate via API
- Password hashing is working correctly  
- JWT tokens are being generated properly
- All endpoints are responding correctly

## 🌐 Frontend Access
- **Login Page**: [http://localhost:3000/login](http://localhost:3000/login)
- **Dashboard**: [http://localhost:3000/dashboard](http://localhost:3000/dashboard) (after login)
- **Live Trading**: [http://localhost:3000/live-trading](http://localhost:3000/live-trading) (after login)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting
If login still doesn't work from the frontend:
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Check the Console tab for any JavaScript errors
3. Check the Network tab to see if requests are being sent correctly
4. Verify the request is going to `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login`

All backend authentication is confirmed working! 🚀
