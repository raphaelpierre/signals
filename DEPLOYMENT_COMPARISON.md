## ❌ Not Recommended

### Vercel
**Why not:**
- ❌ No background workers (serverless only)
- ❌ No WebSocket support
- ❌ 10-60s function timeout (too short for signal generation)
- ❌ No long-running processes

**Best for:** Static sites, Next.js frontend only

### Heroku
**Why not:**
- ⚠️ Expensive ($25-50/month minimum)
- ⚠️ Removed free tier
- ⚠️ Slower deployments
- ✅ But: Very stable, mature platform

### AWS/GCP/Azure
**Why not (for now):**
- ❌ Too complex for MVP
- ❌ Expensive to learn
- ❌ Need DevOps expertise
- ❌ Overkill for current scale

**When to consider:** 10,000+ users, need auto-scaling

# Railway auto-deploys on git push
git push origin main

# Or manually trigger:
# Railway Dashboard → "Deploy"
```

---

## 💡 Alternative: Render (If You Prefer)

Render is also excellent. Setup is similar:

1. Connect GitHub repo
2. Add Web Services (Backend, Worker, Frontend)
3. Add PostgreSQL + Redis
4. Configure environment variables
5. Deploy

Main difference: Render has better free tier but slightly higher production costs.

---

## 🎯 My Final Recommendation

### For SignalStack, choose **Railway** because:

1. ✅ **Fastest time to production** - 5 minutes vs 30+ on alternatives
2. ✅ **All-in-one** - No need for external database services
3. ✅ **Best pricing** - $20/month for everything
4. ✅ **Perfect feature match** - Supports all your requirements
5. ✅ **Great DX** - Beautiful UI, easy debugging

### When to Reconsider:

- **Scale to 10,000+ users?** → Move to AWS/GCP with Kubernetes
- **Need global latency?** → Add Fly.io for edge deployment
- **Budget = $0?** → Use Render's free tier (with sleep limitations)
- **Already on AWS?** → Use ECS/EKS (but more complex)
